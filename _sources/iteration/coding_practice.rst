.. tabbed:: iteration_1

    .. tab:: Question

        Write a program that prints out a 5x5 triangle using asterisks.
        An example is shown below. Your code should use while loops.

        ::

           ****
           ***

           #include <iostream>

           int main() {
               // Write your implementation here.
           }


    .. tab:: Answer

        Below is one way to implement the program. Similar to the right side up
        triangle we saw previously, we can use nested loops.

           #include <iostream>

           int main() {
               for (int row = 0; row < 5; ++row) {
                   for (int col = 5 - row; col > 0; --col) {
                       cout << "*";
                   }
                   cout << endl;
               }
           }

.. activecode:: iteration_ac_2q
    :language: cpp

    Write the previous program, but use while loops instead.

        // Write your implementation here.

.. tabbed:: iteration_3

    .. tab:: Question

        Write a program that prints a pyramid with height 5 like the one shown below.
        Your code should use while loops.

        ::
   
               *
              ***
             *****

        .. activecode:: iteration_ac_3q
           :language: cpp
           :practice: T

           #include <iostream>
           using namespace std;

           int main() {
               // Write your implementation here.
           }


    .. tab:: Answer

        Below is one way to implement the program. We use multiple ``while``
        loops to print out spaces and asterisks. The outer loop creates the
        number of rows, and within the outer loop, the two inner loops
        print out the correct number of spaces and asterisks.

        .. activecode:: iteration_ac_3a
           :language: cpp
           :optional:

           #include <iostream>
           using namespace std;

           int main() {
               int n = 5;
               int space, numAsterisks;
               int count = 1;
               while (count <= n) {
                   space = n - count;
                   while (space > 0) {
                       cout << " ";
                       space--;
                   }
                   numAsterisks = 2 * count - 1;
                   while (numAsterisks > 0) {
                       cout << "*";
                       numAsterisks--;
                   }
                   cout << endl;
                   count++;
               }
           }

.. activecode:: iteration_ac_4q
    :language: cpp
    :practice: T

    Now write a program that prints a number pyramid like the one below. Your code should use while loops.
    (Hint: similar to the previous question, if you want the output to look nice, using conditionals
    that print different amounts of spaces.)

.. tabbed:: iteration_5

    .. tab:: Question

        A common coding interview question that's also a popular children's game used to teach division is
        FizzBuzz. Write a program that uses a for loop and prints the numbers 1 through 100, but every
        multiple of 3 is replaced with the word "Fizz," every multiple of 5 is replaced with the word "Buzz,"
        and every multiple of both 3 and 5 is replaced with "FizzBuzz." Your output should be the following:

        ::
   
           1
           2
           Fizz
           4
           Buzz
           ...
           14
           FizzBuzz
           16
           ...
           98
           Fizz
           Buzz

           int main() {
               // Write your implementation here.
           }


    .. tab:: Answer

        Below is one way to implement the "FizzBuzz" program. We use conditionals
        with modulus operators in a for loop to categorize every number and print
        the correct output. Feel free to search up on the FizzBuzz coding interview
        problem if you are interested in other ways to code this program!

    Help! Young Bobby forgot his multiplication table. Luckily for him, he knows a bit of programming.
    Unfortunately, he doesn't know enough programming. He wants to create a multiplication table like the
    one below, but there are errors in his code. Can you fix them?

    .. tab:: Question

        Write a program that prints out "yes" or "no" depending on whether
        or not a number's digits are all the same. For example, if the number is 1111,
        the program would print out "yes" and if the number is 1234, the program would
        print out "no".

        Below is one way to implement program. We can extract each digit by 
        finding the number mod 10. We check to make sure that all digits 
        are the same and output "yes" or "no" depending on whether or not
        that's true.

        Below is one way to implement the program. We use a for loop

        and ``third``, using the recursive relationship.
