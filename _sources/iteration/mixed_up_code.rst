    The program below should print out the even numbers between 20 and 40, inclusive,
    but the code is mixed up and contains extra blocks. Put the necessary blocks
    in the correct order.
    -----
    int main() {
    =====
       int n = 20;
    =====
       int n = 0; #distractor

    Let's write a program that prints out all numbers from 1 to ``i``, with ``i`` going from 5 to 1.
    For example, the first line should print "1 2 3 4 5", the second line should print "1 2 3 4" and so on until "1".
    Use a nested for loop.

    Help Goku reach power levels of over 9000! Write a program
    which checks if a variable ``powerLevel`` is over 9000. If it
    isn't, it repeatedly prints "More power!" and increments ``powerLevel`` by
    1000 until ``powerLevel`` is over 9000. Then the program prints "It's over 9000!".
    Put the necessary blocks in the correct order.

    =====
       int powerLevel = 6500;
