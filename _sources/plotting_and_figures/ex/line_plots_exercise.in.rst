For this exercise, use the starter script :code:`InternetUsers.m` (which you can download at the top of this chapter), and build off of the plots that we made in the previous video.

Take the following steps to customize these line plots further:

1. Choose a different line color and line type for the line plotting :code:`facebook_years` vs. :code:`facebook_users`. (hint: MATLAB's documentation for :code:`plot` has additional examples that you can use to help you. Look in the "Linespec—Line style, marker, and color" section.)
2. Move the legend to the lower right-hand corner.

  Paste in a copy of your completed :file:`InternetUsers.m` script file.
