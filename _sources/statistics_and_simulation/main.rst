^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Review: Min and Max
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 1

We've previously seen two basic statistical measures of data, the minimum and maximum of a dataset. Recall that MATLAB has built-in functions for finding the maximum and minimum values in a dataset: :code:`max()` and :code:`min()`. Recall, also, that if you use a compound return when calling these functions, you can get both the minimum (or maximum) value and its location in the dataset:

.. image:: img/MaxCompoundReturn.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center
  :alt: The max() function returns both the max value and the index at which it occurred.

|

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Mean, Median, and Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 3

Three other common statistical measures of data are:

- **mean** - the average of the dataset
- **median** - the number that would appear in the middle if the numbers in the dataset were sorted in order
- **mode** - the most common number in the dataset

MATLAB has built-in functions to calculate each of these statistical measures:

- :code:`mean()` 
- :code:`median()` 
- :code:`mode()`

----------------
:code:`mean()`
----------------

The mean function returns the column-by-column mean of a matrix, similar to the sum function from Chapter 3. For example, if we had this matrix :code:`A`:

.. figure:: img/Mean_1.png
  :width: 200
  :align: center
  :alt: A is initialized with A = [2,3,4,3;4,2,3,3];

  ..

And we called :code:`mean(A)`, we would get a row vector that contains the mean values of each column of :code:`A`:

.. figure:: img/Mean_2.png
  :width: 250
  :align: center
  :alt: The result of calling mean(A) is [3, 2.5, 4, 3]

  ..

If you would instead like to work row-by-row and find the means of each row in your matrix, you may specify an additional argument of :code:`2` to specify the 2nd dimension (by rows). For example:

.. figure:: img/Mean_3.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center
  :alt: The result of calling mean(A, 2) is [3.25; 3]

  ..

.. admonition:: Heads Up!

  For a row vector, :code:`mean` returns the mean of that row (rather than the mean of each column, which would be just the vector itself and wouldn't be very useful). This means that if you start with a vector, functions like :code:`mean` will *always* return a single result.

Finally, if you want to get the mean of all the elements in a matrix, you have a few choices:

.. figure:: img/Mean_4.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center
  :alt: Three ways to compute the mean of all elements

  ..

- :code:`mean(mean(A))` - call the mean function twice in succession (means of columns, then the mean of those means)
- :code:`mean(A(:))` - select all the elements in A which creates a column vector; then compute the mean value of the column vector, giving you the mean value of the entire matrix
- :code:`mean(A, 'all')` - the 'all' option tells MATLAB to override the column-by-column default behavior and get all of the elements in A. **Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Engr 101 Autograder cannot handle this option, so please beware and do not use it in your projects!**


----------------
:code:`median()`
----------------

The :code:`median` function returns the median of a dataset, which is the value that would appear in the middle if the data were put into sorted order. If there is an even number of elements, the :code:`median` function averages the two elements in the middle of the sorted elements. It works with arrays in the same way as the :code:`mean` function (i.e. column-by-column, selecting dimensions, etc.).

In the following example, the vector :code:`B` has 10 elements (an even number of elements). After the vector :code:`B` is sorted within the :code:`median()` function, the middle element is found. Since :code:`B` has an even number of elements, the function takes the two elements in the middle and finds the mean of those values (in this case, the mean of the values 5 and 6 is 5.5), and returns that mean value as the median value of vector :code:`B`.

.. figure:: img/Median_1.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: The median of the dataset [5,0,8,9,6,7,7,3,5,1] is 5.5.

  ..

.. admonition:: Danger!

  If you want to take the median of all elements in a matrix :code:`M`, don't use :code:`median(median(M))` - that's not correct because the median of the column medians is not mathematically equivalent to the median of the whole dataset. Instead, use either of the other approaches, :code:`median(M(:))` or :code:`median(M, 'all')`.

--------------
:code:`mode()`
--------------

The :code:`mode` function returns the value of the dataset that occurs most often. It works with arrays in the same way as the :code:`mean` function (i.e. column-by-column, selecting dimensions, etc.).

In the following example, the vector :code:`X` has three elements with the value 8. The value 8 occurs the most times, so that is the mode for this vector:

.. figure:: img/Mode_1.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: The mode of the dataset [1,9,0,7,8,8,0,3,7,8] is 8.

  ..

If you use a compound return, you can also get the frequency of the mode value; the frequency is how many times the mode value occurred. Using our vector :code:`X`:

.. figure:: img/Mode_2.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: The mode of the dataset [1,9,0,7,8,8,0,3,7,8] is 8, which occurs 3 times.

  ..

.. admonition:: Danger!

  If you want to take the mode of all elements in a matrix :code:`M`, don't use :code:`mode(mode(M))` - that's not correct because the mode of the column modes is not mathematically equivalent to the mode of the whole dataset. Instead, use either of the other approaches, :code:`mode(M(:))` or :code:`mode(M, 'all')`.

Histograms
^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 4

A **histogram** is a visualization of the frequency of occurrences for certain values in a dataset. Below is a histogram of the latitude of the world's most populous cities. This histogram was generated from the data in the :file:`cities.xlsx` file we used earlier.

.. figure:: img/Histogram_1.png

This `Exploring Histograms <http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/>`__ website is a spectacular guide to histograms and how they are created. We highly recommend you read this guide before continuing on with the rest of this chapter (it's also a beautiful example of data visualization!). Let's see how we can make histograms in MATLAB.

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  MATLAB has two very useful functions for working with histograms: 

  - :code:`histogram()` - creates a histogram of data by taking the dataset and sorting it into "bins"
  - :code:`histcounts()` - gives you the number of elements belonging to each histogram bin

  Histograms are very sensitive to the size of the bins you use in your histograms. You can specify either the number of bins or the bins themselves in MATLAB.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Variance and Standard Deviation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 5

The mean, median, and mode of a dataset are useful starting points for understanding the characteristics of a dataset, but they are single numbers that describe the average, middle, and most common values (the central tendencies) of the dataset.

**Variance** and **standard deviation** are measures that tell us how "spread out" a dataset is. The standard deviation is just the square root of the variance. Here is a histogram (or **distribution**) of data that is more *narrow* - more of the data points are grouped around a central value (0 in this case):

.. figure:: img/VarStdDev_1.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: A histogram of a narrow distribution centered around 0 with a variance of 0.5537 and standard deviation of 0.7440.

  ..

Here is a histogram of data that is more *wide* - more of the data points are farther away from a central value (0 in this case): 

.. figure:: img/VarStdDev_2.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: A histogram of a wide distribution centered around 0 with a variance of 2.1975 and standard deviation of 1.4824.

  ..

The more narrow distribution's variance is smaller than the wider distribution's variance. Similarly, the more narrow distribution's standard deviation is smaller than the wider distribution's standard deviation. *Therefore, the smaller the variance (or standard deviation), the more narrow the distribution will be.* 

Important things to note when we compare these two figures:

- The x-axes have the same limits, and the y-axes have the same limits. This allows us to directly compare the data visually.
- These figures also have the same underlying "type" of data (normally-distributed random numbers), allowing us to directly compare the variance and standard deviation when we state, "This variance is smaller than that variance." (Comparing the variance of the height of a blade of grass to the variance of the top speed of cheetahs makes no sense.)
- Variance and standard deviation only offer an aggregate measure of the spread of a dataset. It's often important to consider the shape of the distribution as well (e.g. is it a bell curve or a uniform distribution?).

MATLAB has built-in functions to calculate the variance and standard deviation:

- :code:`var()` - variance
- :code:`std()` - standard deviation

.. admonition:: Danger!

  If you want to take the variance (or standard deviation) of all elements in a matrix :code:`M`, don't use :code:`var(var(M))` - that's not correct because the variance of the column variances is not mathematically equivalent to the variance of the whole dataset. Instead, use either of the other approaches, :code:`var(M(:))` or :code:`var(M, 0, 'all')` (the :code:`0` is a weighting value; you can look up the :code:`var` function in the MATLAB documentation to learn more).

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Plots with Error Bars
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 6

Engineering data is often plotted with error bars included. Error bars can be used to convey a range of values for each point on the plot or uncertainty about a measured value. MATLAB's :code:`errorbar` function will create a plot with "error bars" at each data point, like this:

.. figure:: img/SampleErrorPlot.png
  :width: 450
  :align: center
  :alt: A plot including error bars indicates uncertainty.

  You can download the script that generates this plot (:file:`SampleErrorbarPlot.m`) at the top of the chapter.

Let's investigate error bar plots more with a hypothetical example: 

We work for a company that produces smartphones. Our company wants to analyze battery lifetime throughout several years of use to see if we can make the following claims:

1. Our phones have 3 hours battery life when new.
2. After 2 years, our phones will still have 2 hours of battery life.

A battery's lifetime is defined as the length of time the battery can go before needing to be charged. A sample set of our batteries have been put through several years of simulated smartphone use. Twice per "simulated year", the lifetimes of each battery were tested, and the mean and standard deviation of the set were recorded.

We would like to visualize the degradation of battery lifetime throughout the years as well as the amount of variability in the dataset to confirm that the company can make the two claims stated above.

The videos below show how an error bar plot is an effective tool for this analysis. Download :file:`batteryLife.mat` and :file:`AnalyzeBatteries.m` from the top of the chapter to follow along.

First, let's just make the plot.

  We can use :code:`errorbar` to create an error bar plot. We looked at how to customize our plot.

Now, how can we interpret these results?

  Using our error bar plot, we discussed whether the company could make the original two claims that they wanted to make.

.. admonition:: Did you know?

  Putting products through simulated use to test reliability is serious business, and analyses like this example are often used in industry to drive marketing. For example, some of the first phones with foldable screens were put through tens of thousands of flips to help alleviate customer fears about the durability of the screen. Check it out:

MATLAB supports many different random distributions in addition to the distributions we've seen here. There are discrete random distributions for describing random sets of integers; some examples include the Binomial, Multinomial, Geometric, and Poisson distributions. There are continuous random distributions for describing random numbers that can be any value; some examples include the Beta, Gamma, Exponential, Chi-square distributions. As always, check the MATLAB documentation for more information. 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the end of the chapter! Here is a summary of what we covered in this chapter: 

* **MATLAB is often used to analyze data.** We tend to follow a similar pattern each time: Read data in from a file, look for some characteristics/process the data, and plot the data to see trends, patterns, extremes, etc.
* MATLAB has built-in functions for calculating common statistical measures of datasets: :code:`mean` (average), :code:`median`, :code:`mode`, :code:`var` (variance), and :code:`std` (standard deviation).
* The :code:`histogram` function will generate a histogram of a vector of data; if you need the number of occurrences in each bin, use the :code:`histcounts` function.
* Error bars can be used to convey a range of values for each point on the plot or uncertainty about a measured value. MATLAB’s :code:`errorbar` function will create a plot with “error bars” at each data point.
* **MATLAB is also used to simulate data.** When we simulate data, we also tend to follow a similar pattern each time: Convert the math equations into a computer program, create a starter set of data and use the computer program from step 1 to generate  predicted data, and look for some things / process data / plot data to see trends, etc.
* The :code:`linspace` function can be used to generate equally spaced values, similar to the range operator (:code:`:`), to be used as a starter set of data. 
* MATLAB can also generate random values to be used as a starter set of data. The :code:`randi` function generates pseudorandom integers from a uniform discrete distribution.
