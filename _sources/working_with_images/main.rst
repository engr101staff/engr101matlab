  We'll be using several files throughout this chapter's exercises. It might be helpful to go ahead and download each of them now and move them to your current folder in MATLAB. (It's also a good idea to go ahead and create a new folder for this chapter and use that as your current folder, so that you don't clutter up whatever else you were working on.)

  For some of the videos in this chapter, the *file names* you see us using might be slightly different than the versions you download. Make sure you're using the correct name, which might not match the video or might have a slightly different file extension.

Loading and Saving Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 3

To begin, let's see how to load and save images in MATLAB.

.. youtube:: hfjwgcbH44M
  :divid: ch05_03_vid_loading_and_saving_images
  :height: 315
  :width: 560
  :align: center

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  To **load** image data from a file into a matrix, use the :code:`imread()` function. To **save** a matrix as an image file, use the :code:`imwrite()` function. MATLAB can handle most common image file formats.

  To **display** a matrix as an image in a **figure window**, use the :code:`imshow()` function (sometimes the figure window will open "underneath" the other matlab window. You might need to go to your taskbar to find it).

.. Tip::

  Remember, when you specify a file name for MATLAB, you should use the single quotes and make sure to include the file extension (the part after the dot in the file name).

  Finally, you'll usually want to remember to **add the semicolon** :code:`;` **to suppress output when working with images**, since otherwise the result will print out at the command window - for an image, the result may be *huge*, which makes this behavior annoying.

We can use MATLAB to create, store, and manipulate grayscale images. A grayscale image is represented as a grid of **intensity values** (i.e. bright vs. dark). In MATLAB, we represent this as a matrix of numbers!

There are two ways to represent an image numerically: either using **integers** or using **doubles**. Like in math, integers are whole real numbers, like 1, 2, and -1. Doubles are numbers that have a decimal component, like 1.5, -2.7, and 3.0.

  :height: 315
  :width: 560
  :align: center

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  Each cell in the matrix represents a pixel of the picture. Each pixel is simply a single intensity value (the higher the value, the closer to white). Intensity values are represented either as integers between 0 and 255 (inclusive), or doubles between 0 and 1 (inclusive).

By default, images you load through :code:`imread()` are generally going to be in the 0 to 255 format, so we'll work with that for now.

Let's work through a few examples to give you some practice working with images.

Contrast Stretching

---------------------
Thresholding
---------------------

Sometimes you might be interested in identifying particular pixels in an image which are above or below a particular threshold. Logical indexing works well for this.

.. youtube:: uCQ4LK4Zrgs
  :divid: ch05_04_vid_thresholding
  :height: 315
  :width: 560
  :align: center

.. admonition:: Video Recap
  
  To do image **thresholding**, first choose a threshold value. Then, set all values above the threshold to white (255). Set all values below or equal to the threshold to black (0).

.. tip::

  You can also use :code:`imshow` to display a logical matrix directly, e.g. :code:`imshow(img > 200)`, and the figure window will show a black-and-white image (white corresponds to true values in the image, and black to false).


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RGB Color Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 5

We've seen how to represent grayscale image, but what about color images?

We could try assigning a number to each color (e.g. 0 = red, 1 = orange, 2 = blue). However, we need a strategy that can represent every possible color, and there are a lot more than 256 colors! A fixed set of colors also doesn't allow us to dynamically adjust colors (e.g. to be lighter, darker, more intense) in a way that matches our human understanding of color.

You may be familiar with the way printers use a combination of three *primary colors* to create other colors. We'll do something similar, but using the primary colors of light - red, green, and blue (RGB). If we use 256 possible values for each primary color, we get a total of over 16 million different color combinations!

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  A color image is represented by three different **color channels**, layered on top of each other like a 3D array. To access values in a 3D array, instead of row/column indexing, we use row/column/layer indexing.

.. section 6

How do we work with color images?

.. youtube:: WOxAHmEYnOY
  :divid: ch05_06_vid_single_channel
  :height: 315
  :width: 560
  :align: center

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  There are two main ways you might choose to work with an image: 1) all the channels together (the whole image) OR 2) one channel at a time. Here's what the two look like as indexing expressions:

  - :code:`img(___, ___, :)` means that you want the **whole** image. The colon in the layer indicator means that you're selecting all of the channels (layers) at once.
  - :code:`img(___, ___, 2)` means, for example, that you want a **single channel** - the 2nd (green) in this case.

  When you would like to do more complicated operations on one of the channels in an image, you sometimes need to "take out the channel, work with it, and then copy it back in".

  .. code-block:: matlab

    red = img(:,:,1); % Pull out a copy of the red channel
    
    red(:) = 255; % Make changes to the red channel

    img(:,:,1) = red; % Copy the red channel data back into the original image

Let's look at some examples of manipulating color images:

HSV Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 7

Representing images using RGB color channels works well for some image operations, but doesn't work well for everything that we want to do. For example, consider **color desaturation**.

.. figure:: img/desaturation.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center
   :alt: desaturation.png

   Desaturation is the process of removing color from all or part of an image (e.g. the blue sea/sky in this image). It can produce some pretty cool, dramatic effects.

What happens if we try to desaturate an RGB image?

.. youtube:: ATHtSPAy4-w
  :divid: ch05_06_vid_rgb_desaturation
  :height: 315
  :width: 560
  :align: center

.. admonition :: Video Recap

  Image desaturation is a good example of a case where RGB colors don't provide an intuitive way to manipulate an image, even though they mimic the way our eyes perceive color. We can't identify the blue colors in the background by just looking at the blue channel, because making the color "blue" actually depends on the ratio of all three R, G, and B channels.

For color desaturation, it would be helpful if we could represent our color images a different way! In addition to RGB, you can also represent color images using channels for the **hue**, **saturation**, and **value** (HSV) of each pixel. Here's the basic idea of each:

- **Hue**: "Which basic color is it?"
- **Saturation**: "How strong is the color?"
- **Value**: "How bright is it?"

.. figure:: img/hsv.png
   :width: 400

   The HSV color space

Here's the boat picture again and a representation of what the data in each channel looks like:

.. list-table:: 
  :align: center
  :widths: auto

        :alt: boat_saturation.jpg

        Saturation
    - .. figure:: img/boat_value.jpg
        :width: 180
        :align: center
        :alt: boat_value.jpg

        Value

Take a moment to think about why the hue, saturation, and value channels look the way they do for the boat image.

- **Hue.** We expect to see all the blue colors in the hue channel, but note that the sails (which look white in the original picture) have varying hues throughout. Why?
- **Saturation.** We can see some areas have lower (darker) saturation, while others have higher (lighter) saturation. The reason the sails look white in the original picture, and not blue, orange, or pink, is that the corresponding saturation levels are low -- there might be a color, but there is very little of that color. You can see this in the color space diagram - as you dial down saturation and go the center of the cylinder, you approach gray regardless of the hue.
- **Value.** The value channel determines the brightness of a pixel. For example, the waves have a lower (darker) value than the sky, since they are a darker shade of blue.

We can start to see how all three channels work together to represent the original picture. The dark blue water has a blue hue, medium saturation, and low value. The white sails have varying hues throughout, but the low saturation and high value combine to give the sails their more-or-less white color. 

The HSV representation in MATLAB uses double values that range between 0 and 1, rather than integers between 0 and 255. So a "fully" saturated pixel would have a value of 1 in the saturation channel.

-------------------------------
Converting Between RGB and HSV
-------------------------------

MATLAB provides two functions for converting between RGB and HSV image representations. Let's say you have a 3D matrix called :code:`img` representing an image in RGB and want to convert it to a 3D matrix with HSV representation:

.. code-block:: matlab

  hsv = rgb2hsv(img);

In the other direction, you can convert back using:

.. code-block:: matlab

  img = hsv2rgb(hsv);

.. admonition :: Warning!

  :code:`imshow()` only works with RGB matrices. If you want to look at an HSV image, convert it before using :code:`imshow()`.

Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the end of the chapter! Here is a summary of what we covered in this chapter: 

* To load images into a matrix, use :code:`imread()`. To save an image matrix as a file, use :code:`imwrite()`. To display a matrix as an image, use :code:`imshow()`.
* **Integers** are whole real numbers (e.g,. 1, 2, 3). **Doubles** are floating point numbers (e.g., decimals like 1.5, 2.7, and 3.0).
* In MATLAB, grayscale images are represented by a matrix with intensity values (0-255 or 0-1).
* **Contrast stretching** “stretches out” the range of intensity values by making sure that the values go all the way from 0 to 255 (instead of having a narrower range of values).
* To do **image thresholding**, first choose a threshold value. Then, set all values above the threshold to white (255). Set all values below or equal to the threshold to black (0).
* In MATLAB, RGB color images are represented by a matrix with three separate channels (three different 2D matrices) which represent the red, green, and blue portions of each pixel. To access values in a 3D array, we use row/column/layer indexing.
* When manipulating images, you can either work with the whole image, or work with a single channel at a time. For more complicated manipulations, you may need to make a copy of the channel, make adjustments, and then replace the original channel.
* **Image desaturation** is the process of removing color from all or part of an image.
* In MATLAB, HSV color images are represented by a matrix with three separate channels (three different 2D matrices) which represent the hue, saturation, and brightness value portions of each pixel.
* To convert from RGB to HSV, use :code:`rgb2hsv()`. To convert from HSV to RGB, use :code:`hsv2rgb()`. Remember that to show an image using :code:`imshow()`, it **must be** an RGB image so don't forget to convert before using that command.
