.. admonition:: Video Recap

  Indexing into a vector of vectors *selects a vector*. To select an element from that vector, *index again*. Like indexing into a single vector, you can use :code:`.at()` to index, which checks that the index is valid but is slightly slower.

**Knowledge Check:** Here is a vector of vectors named :code:`v2`:

.. figure:: img/VectorOfVectors1.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center
   :alt: A vector of vectors containing 3 vectors. The first inner vector contains 5, 2, 23, 8. The second inner vector contains 42, 42. The third inner vector contains 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

---------------------------------------------
Exercise: Printing a Vector of Vectors
---------------------------------------------

This image of :code:`v2` is very helpful for understanding what is in :code:`v2`:

.. figure:: img/VectorOfVectors1.png
   :width: 600
   :align: center
   :alt: A vector of vectors containing 3 vectors. The first inner vector contains 5, 2, 23, 8. The second inner vector contains 42, 42. The third inner vector contains 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

   ..

But C++ can't make this representation of :code:`v2`; we need to figure out a different way to print out the contents of a vector of vectors. Something like this should work okay:

.. code-block:: none

   { 5 2 23 8 }
   { 42 42 }
   { 2 3 4 5 11 13 }

This isn't the prettiest representation of the data in :code:`v2`, but we can still see all the values so it's fine for our purposes here. The first "row" in this representation corresponds to the vector in :code:`v2.at(0)` (or :code:`v2[0]` if you prefer to use the :code:`[]` method), the second "row" corresponds to the vector in :code:`v2.at(1)` (or :code:`v2[1]` ), and so on until all the data is printed. Let's write a function to print out a vector of vectors of :code:`int` using this representation. 

Download the :file:`printVectorOfVectors.cpp` file from the beginning of the chapter and complete the missing parts of the :code:`printVecOfVecs` function. Compile the code using the :code:`-std=c++11` flag like this: 

.. code-block:: console

   g++ -std=c++11 printVectorOfVectors.cpp -o printVectorOfVectors

We would like to change the contents of :code:`v2` to match "State 2":

   State 2

Arrange the lines of code below such that they would change :code:`v2` from "State 1" to "State 2". Some lines contain mistakes or are unnecessary - these lines should not be used.

   vector&lt;int&gt; temp(2,0); #distractor

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Application: Analyzing Data in a Matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 7

As we saw in MATLAB, a common computing task is analyzing data. Let's practice using the vector of vectors data structure by writing a program to read in data to a matrix and then analyze the data. Make sure that you have downloaded :file:`testData.txt` and :file:`analyzeData.cpp` from the beginning of the chapter.

The :file:`testData.txt` file has some sample test data in it. Here is the contents of the file: 

.. code-block:: none

   numRows 5
   numCols 7

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
   8 9 10 11 12 13 14
   15 16 17 18 19 20 21
   22 23 24 25 26 27 28
   29 30 31 32 33 34 35

This is a small dataset so it's easier for us to work with here in Runestone. But real datasets can have millions of data points, so we should write our program to be as reasonably flexible as possible.

Debugging the Program
---------------------

Is your program not compiling and/or not running? To debug your program, you need to find where in the code things are not working correctly. Here are some ways to find the place(s) where your code's behavior deviates from what you want it to do:

1. Use the :code:`printVecOfInts` and :code:`printVecOfVecs` helper functions to print out the values in your vectors and vectors of vectors at different points in your code. There is an example of this in the main function: the :code:`printVecOfVecs` helper function is used to print out the values of the "matrix" so that we can check if what we read in matches what is in the text file. After you have verified the data, you can comment out these lines.
2. Use :code:`cout` statements like, :code:`"This is the start of the sumOfRows function"` to help you see how far your program gets before it crashes, throws an error, or otherwise stops working correctly.
3. Use :code:`cout` statements that print out the value of the index variable in a for loop to help debug loops, especially nested loops. 

If your code compiles and runs but then gets to a point where it "doesn't seem to do anything", then you might have one of these situations: 

A. There is a stray :code:`cin` statement somewhere and the program is "not doing anything" because it's waiting for you to type something and hit *enter*. (Note: this particular program does not require user input via :code:`cin`, so :code:`cin` should not be anywhere in your finished program.)
B. There is an infinite loop somewhere. In this case, fall back on method #3 above to help you debug the loop. 

If you've tried all these tricks and your program still won't compile and/or run, please watch the walkthroughs!

Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the end of the chapter! Here is a summary of what we covered in this chapter: 

* We can created nested vectors, which are useful for storing matrix data. When working with a vector of vectors, make sure to keep track of whether you are working with the *inner* vector or the *outer* vector.
* To index into a vector of vectors, you need to index twice - once for the inner vector and once for the outer vector. For example, :code:`vec[0][1]` or :code:`vec.at(0).at(1)`.
* Use a doubly-nested loop to print out a vector of vectors (or to iterate through a vector of vectors, more generally).
* If we are representing a matrix with a vector of vector, each vector represents a row. Elements within represent different columns.
