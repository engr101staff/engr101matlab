Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. section 1

In this chapter, we will dive deeper into data visualization and learn how to use MATLAB to plot in a three-dimensional space.

In Ch. 5, we used three dimensional arrays to represent images with rows, columns, and layers. We can represent all sorts of datasets in 3D space as a set of (x,y,z) values. When we use 3D arrays to hold data for spatial coordinates, trends, or maps, it is useful to visualize the data we are using in order to understand and communicate what we're working with.

3D Plotting Using Vectors of Data

.. section 2

Let's look at two useful MATLAB functions for simple plots of 3D data. Follow along with :code:`Demo.m` from the top of the chapter.

  :code:`plot3` and :code:`scatter3` can be used to make 3D plots. :code:`plot3` works analogously to its regular 2D counterpart :code:`plot`; :code:`plot3` uses three vectors for x, y, and z data. :code:`scatter3` -- works analogously to its regular 2D counterpart :code:`scatter`; :code:`scatter3` uses three vectors for x, y, and z data.

Exercise: Plotting 3D Vectors
-----------------------------

.. shortanswer:: ch09_02_ex_plotting_3d_vectors

  Consider the equation:

  .. math::

    z = x + x * sin(\frac{y}{50})

  How could we plot this in MATLAB? We know that MATLAB does't plot math functions, only data points. Open MATLAB and create the variables :code:`x` and :code:`y` where:

  - :code:`x` is a vector containing the values from :code:`0.5` to :code:`200` in steps of :code:`0.5`
  - :code:`y` is a vector containing the values from :code:`1` to :code:`800` in steps of :code:`2`

  Create the vectors described and then calculate the vector of values :code:`z` using the equation above. Plot :code:`x`, :code:`y`, and :code:`z` using :code:`scatter3` and :code:`plot3`. Which of the two functions do you think is  most appropriate for use with this data? Why?

.. admonition:: Video Recap

  The previous exercise used vectors to plot a solution to the equation: 

  .. math::

    z = x + x * sin(\frac{y}{50})

  But these vectors gave us only one line (or set of markers if you used :code:`scatter3`). This math equation actually states that :code:`z` is a function of :code:`x` and :code:`y` for all possible combinations of the values for :code:`x` and :code:`y`. This means that :code:`z` is a surface that is defined by this equationâ€¦ and right now all we have is one "slice" of that surface: the particular combination of :code:`x` and :code:`y` coordinates in our vectors. To fully represent the surface defined by the equation,

  .. math::

    Z = X + X * sin(\frac{Y}{50})

  we will need to calculate an array for :code:`Z` that contains all the possible combinations of :code:`X` and :code:`Y` coordinates. In other words, we need matrices not vectors. 

  MATLAB has a built-in function called :code:`meshgrid()` that will convert our vectors :code:`x` and :code:`y` into their corresponding matrices :code:`X` and :code:`Y` so that we can properly visualize our math equation.

  The :code:`meshgrid` function takes two vectors as inputs and returns two matrices, one where each row is a copy of the first input, and another where each column is a copy of the second input. For example:

  .. code-block:: matlab

    x = -2:1:2;
    y = -2:1:2;
    [X, Y] = meshgrid(x,y);

.. section 8

This exercise uses :file:`dist2green.m` and :file:`LandOnGreen.m` from the beginning of the chapter.

Let's practice some more with creating contour plots and using :code:`subplot`. This is the 17th hole at the TPC Sawgrass golf course.

.. figure:: img/Golf1.png
    :width: 400
    :align: center

    ..

It is 120 meters from the tee box to the hole on the island green.  But if you hit the ball in the water, you lose a stroke and have to hit again, so that's bad. We want to answer the question: **How fast** and at **what angle** should you hit the ball so it lands on the green instead of in the water?

This is an optimization problem. We want to check all possible combinations of "how fast" and "what angle" and find out which combinations put the ball on the green instead of in the water. Here is our algorithm for solving this optimization problem using computing: 

1. Write a function :code:`dist2green` that calculates the distance a golf ball will travel before it hits the ground. Use these two MATLAB versions of the projectile motion equations:

.. code-block:: matlab

  t = 2 .* speed .* sin(angle) ./ 9.8  % g = 9.8 m/s^2
  distance = speed .* cos(angle) .* t

2. Use :code:`meshgrid` to create matrices that correspond to the different speed and angle combinations. These should be saved in variables named :code:`V` and :code:`T`, respectively.
3. Calculate the distance traveled for each speed/angle combination by calling :code:`dist2green` and passing the matrices created by :code:`meshgrid`. This should be saved in a variable named :code:`distance`.
4. Make two plots to interpret your simulation:

   a. A :code:`contourf` plot of speed, angle, and distance
   b. A :code:`contourf` plot of the viable combinations of speed and angle 

Open :file:`LandOnGreen.m` in MATLAB. We've provided an outline for your code, as well as some initial code. Complete the :file:`LandOnGreen.m`  script to plot both contour plots in the same figure, like this:

This is the end of the chapter! Here is a summary of what we covered in this chapter: 

* Use :code:`plot3` and :code:`scatter3` to make 3D line plots and scatter plots.
* The :code:`meshgrid` function takes two vectors as inputs and returns two matrices, one where each row is a copy of the first input, and another where each column is a copy of the second input.
* You can use the :code:`meshgrid` function to create a set of (x,y) coordinates that can be used as starter data for problems that have a range of possible values for two different variables. 
* Use :code:`surf` to create surface plots, and :code:`mesh` to create mesh plots.
* Use :code:`contour` to create contour plots, and :code:`contourf` to create filled contour plots.
* You can create visuals that compare different datasets using :code:`subplot`. 
* You can solve optimization problems by using MATLAB's ability to quickly simulate starter data and generate a range of solutions. You can investigate the range of solutions and pick the one that is the best (or most realistic) solution for your problem.
